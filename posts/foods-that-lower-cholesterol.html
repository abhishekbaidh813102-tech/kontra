      <h2>Understanding Cholesterol: The Good vs. The Bad</h2>
      <p>Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood that your body needs to build healthy cells. However, high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. There are two main types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):</strong> Often called "bad" cholesterol. High levels can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries.</li>
        <li><strong>HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):</strong> Known as "good" cholesterol. It helps carry away LDL cholesterol, keeping your arteries clean.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal is to lower LDL and raise HDL, and diet is one of the most powerful tools to achieve this balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Oats and Barley: The Soluble Fiber Powerhouses</h2>
      <p>Starting your day with a bowl of oatmeal or incorporating barley into your meals is a fantastic way to lower cholesterol.</p>

      <p>These grains are rich in a type of soluble fiber called <strong>beta-glucan</strong>. This fiber forms a gel in your digestive tract that binds to cholesterol and bile acids, preventing them from being absorbed into the bloodstream and helping to flush them out of the body.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>2. Nuts and Seeds: Healthy Fats and Sterols</h2>
      <p>Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are not only delicious but also incredibly beneficial for your heart.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508061238255-7f2f13ab41b5?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop" alt="A variety of nuts and seeds, such as almonds, walnuts, and flaxseeds, in small bowls.">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fats:</strong> These healthy fats help lower LDL cholesterol levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant Sterols:</strong> Nuts are also a source of plant sterols, natural compounds that have a similar structure to cholesterol and help block its absorption in the gut.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Quick Tip:</strong> A small handful (about 1.5 ounces) of nuts per day is all you need to reap the benefits.
    </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Avocados: A Creamy Dose of Monounsaturated Fat</h2>
      <p>Avocados are a potent source of monounsaturated fats and fiber, a winning combination for fighting high cholesterol.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523049673857-eb18f1d7b578?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop" alt="Freshly sliced avocado on whole-grain toast.">
      <p>Studies have shown that consuming one avocado per day can significantly reduce levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol, particularly the small, dense LDL particles that are most harmful to arteries. They also contribute to raising "good" HDL cholesterol.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Fatty Fish: The Omega-3 Champions</h2>
      <p>Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are packed with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.</p>

      <p>Omega-3s don't lower LDL cholesterol directly, but they offer other significant heart benefits, including reducing triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood), lowering blood pressure, and reducing the risk of blood clots. Aim for at least two servings of fatty fish per week.</p>
