      <h2>What is High Blood Pressure?</h2>
      <p>
        High blood pressure, or <strong>hypertension</strong>, is a chronic condition where blood flow exerts excessive force on the walls of arteries. It can lead to serious health issues like heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. Often called the “silent killer,” symptoms may go unnoticed for years.

      <p>
        Blood pressure is recorded as two values, for example 120/80 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). Healthy adults should check it regularly with a digital monitor and keep a log to share with their doctor.

      <p>
        If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, doctors prescribe BP medicines such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or diuretics. Never skip doses and report side-effects right away. Schedule regular doctor visits for checkups.

      <h2>Important Details About High Blood Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        High blood pressure (hypertension) is a chronic medical condition where the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high, which can cause heart and kidney damage over time. It is measured in two numbers—the higher systolic pressure and the lower diastolic pressure. Normal blood pressure is usually around 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg is considered high and requires medical attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Causes of hypertension include genetic factors, obesity, poor diet (especially too much salt), chronic stress, lack of exercise, and underlying health conditions such as diabetes or kidney disease. It is often called a “silent killer” because it may not cause noticeable symptoms until serious complications arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Management of high blood pressure includes lifestyle modifications such as increased physical activity, dietary changes emphasizing low salt and heart-healthy foods, stress reduction techniques, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. When lifestyle changes alone do not control blood pressure adequately, doctors often prescribe medication including ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, or calcium channel blockers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular monitoring of blood pressure at home or in clinical settings is essential for tracking treatment effectiveness. Many patients benefit from keeping a daily log to share with their healthcare provider. Early diagnosis and consistent management reduce risks of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prevention strategies focus on maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol. Stress management and adequate sleep also play key roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice and do not stop medication without medical guidance.
